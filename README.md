## Data Structures and Algorithms

When divided into parts, namely data structure and algorithm; one may follow the below topics in-order while starting to learn DSA:

### Data Structure: 
1. Array
1. String
1. Matrix
1. Linked List
1. Stack
1. Queue
1. Tree
1. Graph, etc

### Algorithms: 
1. Searching
1. Sorting
1. Hashing
1. Prefix sum
1. Suffix Sum
1. Greedy
1. Recursion
1. Backtracking
1. Tree and Graph traversals
1. Dynamic Programming
1. Advanced algorithms on tree and graph

# Learning is a continuous process.
